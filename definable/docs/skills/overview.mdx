Skills are a higher-level abstraction that combines **instructions** (domain expertise), **tools** (capabilities), and **dependencies** (shared config) into a single reusable unit. They're the recommended way to compose agent behavior.

## Quick Example

```python
from definable.agents import Agent
from definable.models import OpenAIChat
from definable.skills import Calculator, DateTime

agent = Agent(
  model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
  skills=[Calculator(), DateTime()],
)

output = agent.run("What is 2^10? And what day of the week is it?")
print(output.content)
```

Skills inject their instructions into the system prompt and register their tools automatically.

## Creating a Skill

### Inline (Instance-Based)

Pass tools and instructions directly:

```python
from definable.skills import Skill
from definable.tools import tool

@tool
def search_docs(query: str) -> str:
  """Search the documentation."""
  return docs.search(query)

support = Skill(
  name="support",
  instructions="You are a support specialist. Always cite sources.",
  tools=[search_docs],
)

agent = Agent(model=model, skills=[support])
```

### Class-Based (Reusable)

Subclass `Skill` for configurable, reusable skills with lifecycle hooks:

```python
from definable.skills import Skill
from definable.tools import tool

class CustomerSupport(Skill):
  name = "customer_support"
  instructions = "You are a support specialist. Look up orders before answering."

  def __init__(self, db_url: str):
    super().__init__(dependencies={"db_url": db_url})

  def setup(self):
    """Called once when the agent initializes."""
    self._db = connect(self.dependencies["db_url"])

  def teardown(self):
    """Called when the agent shuts down."""
    self._db.close()

  @tool
  def lookup_order(self, order_id: str) -> str:
    """Look up an order by ID."""
    return self._db.query(order_id)

agent = Agent(model=model, skills=[CustomerSupport(db_url="sqlite:///orders.db")])
```

Methods decorated with `@tool` are auto-discovered — no need to pass them explicitly.

## Skill Constructor

```python
from definable.skills import Skill

skill = Skill(
  name="my_skill",
  instructions="Domain expertise...",
  tools=[my_tool],
  dependencies={"api_key": "..."},
)
```

<ParamField path="name" type="str">
  Skill identifier. Defaults to the class name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="instructions" type="str">
  Domain expertise text injected into the system prompt. Override `get_instructions()` for dynamic content.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tools" type="List[Function]">
  Explicit list of tool functions. If not provided, tools are auto-discovered from `@tool`-decorated methods.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="dependencies" type="Dict[str, Any]">
  Shared configuration accessible via `self.dependencies` in methods and tools.
</ParamField>

## Lifecycle Hooks

| Method | When | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `setup()` | Agent init | One-time initialization (DB connections, API clients). Non-fatal if it raises. |
| `teardown()` | Agent shutdown | Cleanup resources. |
| `get_instructions()` | Every model call | Return instructions for system prompt. Override for dynamic content. |

## Combining Multiple Skills

Skills compose naturally — their tools and instructions are merged:

```python
from definable.skills import Calculator, DateTime, WebSearch, Shell

agent = Agent(
  model=model,
  skills=[
    Calculator(),
    DateTime(),
    WebSearch(),
    Shell(allowed_commands={"ls", "cat", "grep"}),
  ],
)
```

Tool names must be unique across all skills. Skills listed later take priority if names overlap.
