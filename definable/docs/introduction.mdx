## What is Definable?

Definable is a Python framework for building AI-powered applications. It provides a unified interface across multiple LLM providers, a powerful agent runtime with tool execution, a complete RAG pipeline for knowledge retrieval, and first-class MCP (Model Context Protocol) support.

  <Card title="Models" icon="microchip" href="/models/overview">
    Unified interface for OpenAI, DeepSeek, Moonshot, xAI, and any OpenAI-compatible provider. Supports streaming, structured output, vision, and audio.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agents" icon="robot" href="/agents/overview">
    Autonomous agents with tool calling, middleware, tracing, multi-turn conversations, and streaming. Built for production with retries, compression, and testing utilities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tools" icon="wrench" href="/tools/overview">
    Define tools with a simple decorator. Supports type-safe parameters, pre/post hooks, result caching, dependency injection, and async execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge" icon="book" href="/knowledge/overview">
    Full RAG pipeline with document readers, text chunkers, embedding providers, rerankers, and vector databases. Plug into agents automatically or on-demand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP" icon="plug" href="/mcp/overview">
    Connect to MCP servers over stdio, SSE, or HTTP transports. Discover and call tools, read resources, and use prompts from any MCP-compatible server.

  <Card title="Toolkits" icon="toolbox" href="/toolkits/overview">
    Bundle related tools into reusable toolkits. Built-in toolkits for knowledge search and MCP server integration.

## Architecture Overview

Definable is organized into composable layers that work together:

````mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph agentLayer [Agent]
    Middleware
    Tracing
    Config
  end
  subgraph modelLayer ["Model (LLM Provider)"]
    OpenAI
    DeepSeek
    Moonshot
    xAI
    Custom
  end
  subgraph capLayer [Capabilities]
    ToolsToolkits["Tools & Toolkits"]
    KnowledgeRAG["Knowledge (RAG)"]
    MCP
  end
  agentLayer --> modelLayer --> capLayer
````

## Key Features

- **Multi-provider**: Switch between OpenAI, DeepSeek, Moonshot, xAI, or any OpenAI-compatible API with one line.
- **Sync and async**: Every API has both synchronous and asynchronous variants.
- **Streaming**: Stream responses token-by-token with rich event types for tool calls, reasoning, and content.
- **Structured output**: Return Pydantic models directly from LLM calls with JSON Schema validation.
- **Middleware**: Compose logging, retry, metrics, and custom middleware around agent execution.
- **Full RAG pipeline**: Ingest documents from text, PDF, or URLs; chunk, embed, store, and retrieve with reranking.
- **MCP support**: Connect to any MCP server and use its tools, resources, and prompts inside your agents.
- **Testing**: Mock models, test agents without API calls, and assert on tool execution.
- **Cost tracking**: Automatic token counting and cost calculation across providers.
- **Interfaces**: Deploy agents to Telegram (and more) with automatic sessions, hooks, and media handling.
- **Type-safe**: Built on Pydantic with full type annotations and mypy support.
