Tracing captures every significant event during an agent run — model calls, tool executions, errors — and exports them to one or more backends. This gives you full visibility into what your agent did and why.

## Enabling Tracing

Pass `tracing` directly to the `Agent` constructor:

```python
from definable.agent import Agent, JSONLExporter
from definable.agent.tracing import Tracing
from definable.model import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tracing=Tracing(
        enabled=True,
        exporters=[JSONLExporter("./traces")],
    ),
)

output = agent.run("Hello!")
# Trace written to ./traces/{session_id}.jsonl
```

Alternatively, tracing can also be configured via `AgentConfig` for backward compatibility:

```python
from definable.agent import Agent, AgentConfig, JSONLExporter
from definable.agent.tracing import Tracing

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    config=AgentConfig(tracing=Tracing(exporters=[JSONLExporter("./traces")])),
)
```

When both `Agent(tracing=...)` and `AgentConfig(tracing=...)` are supplied, the direct `tracing` parameter takes precedence.

## Tracing Reference

<ParamField path="enabled" type="bool" default="true">
  Enable or disable tracing.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="exporters" type="List[TraceExporter]">
  List of exporter instances that receive trace events.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="event_filter" type="Callable">
  Optional function to filter which events are exported. Return `True` to include, `False` to skip.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="batch_size" type="int" default="1">
  Number of events to batch before flushing to exporters.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="flush_interval_ms" type="int" default="5000">
  Maximum time in milliseconds between flushes.
</ParamField>

## JSONLExporter

The built-in exporter writes one JSON object per line to a file, organized by session ID:

```python
from definable.agent import JSONLExporter

exporter = JSONLExporter(
    trace_dir="./traces",
    flush_each=True,          # Flush after every event
    mirror_stdout=False,      # Also print events to stdout
)
```

Each file is named `{session_id}.jsonl`. Events include timestamps, run IDs, and full event data.

### Reading Trace Files

```python
from definable.agent.tracing import read_trace_file, read_trace_events

# Read raw lines
lines = read_trace_file("./traces/abc-123.jsonl")

# Read as parsed event dicts
events = read_trace_events("./traces/abc-123.jsonl")
for event in events:
    print(f"{event['event']} at {event['timestamp']}")
```

## Event Filtering

Skip noisy events to keep traces focused:

```python
agent = Agent(
    model=model,
    tracing=Tracing(
        exporters=[JSONLExporter("./traces")],
        event_filter=lambda e: e.event != "RunContent",  # Skip streaming chunks
    ),
)
```

## Traced Events

| Event | When It Fires |
|-------|---------------|
| `RunStarted` | Agent begins a run |
| `RunContent` | A content chunk is generated (streaming) |
| `RunContentCompleted` | Content generation is finished |
| `ToolCallStarted` | A tool call begins executing |
| `ToolCallCompleted` | A tool call finishes |
| `ToolCallError` | A tool call fails |
| `ReasoningStep` | A reasoning step is produced |
| `RunCompleted` | The run finishes successfully |
| `RunError` | The run fails with an error |

## Custom Exporters

Implement the `TraceExporter` protocol to send events to any backend:

```python
from definable.agent.tracing import TraceExporter

class DatadogExporter:
    """Send trace events to Datadog."""

    async def export(self, events):
        for event in events:
            await send_to_datadog(event.to_dict())

    async def flush(self):
        pass

    async def shutdown(self):
        pass
```

Use it alongside other exporters:

```python
agent = Agent(
    model=model,
    tracing=Tracing(
        exporters=[
            JSONLExporter("./traces"),
            DatadogExporter(),
        ],
    ),
)
```

## NoOpExporter

Use `NoOpExporter` to discard all events. Useful in tests where you want tracing enabled but don't need output:

```python
from definable.agent import Agent
from definable.agent.tracing import Tracing, NoOpExporter

agent = Agent(
    model=model,
    tracing=Tracing(exporters=[NoOpExporter()]),
)
```

<Note>
Tracing failures never break agent execution. If an exporter raises an exception, the error is suppressed and the agent continues normally.
