## When to Use

Use this skill when analyzing datasets, interpreting numbers, identifying trends, comparing metrics, or drawing conclusions from quantitative information.

## Steps

1. **Understand the data**: Identify what each field/column represents, the data types, units, and time ranges. Note any metadata.
2. **Check quality**: Look for missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Note data limitations before drawing conclusions.
3. **Explore patterns**: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, range, distribution shape). Identify trends, clusters, and anomalies.
4. **Compare**: When comparing groups or time periods, use appropriate baselines and normalize for relevant factors (size, time, population).
5. **Interpret**: Explain what the patterns mean in context. Distinguish between correlation and causation.
6. **Present**: Choose the clearest way to communicate findings (tables, ranked lists, percentages, comparisons).

## Rules

- Always state the sample size and time period when presenting statistics.
- Use percentages AND absolute numbers together — "15% (150 out of 1,000)" is clearer than either alone.
- Do not imply causation from correlation without explicit justification.
- Acknowledge confounding variables and alternative explanations.
- Round numbers appropriately — false precision (34.7823%) implies more accuracy than the data supports.
- When comparing, always specify the baseline: "20% higher than last quarter" not just "20% higher."

## Output Format

1. **Summary**: Key finding in 1-2 sentences.
2. **Data Overview**: What data was analyzed, its scope, and any quality issues.
3. **Findings**: Organized by theme, with specific numbers and comparisons.
4. **Interpretation**: What the findings mean in context, including limitations.
5. **Recommendations**: Actions suggested by the data (if applicable).
