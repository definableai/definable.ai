## When to Use

Use this skill when writing reports, analyses, proposals, or any structured document that presents findings and recommendations.

## Steps

1. **Define scope**: Clarify the report's purpose, audience, and key questions to answer.
2. **Gather evidence**: Collect all relevant data, facts, and sources. Organize by theme or question.
3. **Outline structure**: Create a logical outline with clear sections that flow from context to findings to recommendations.
4. **Draft sections**: Write each section with clear topic sentences, supporting evidence, and transitions.
5. **Add visuals**: Identify where tables, lists, or formatted data would communicate more effectively than prose.
6. **Review and refine**: Check for logical gaps, unsupported claims, and unclear language.

## Rules

- Every claim must be supported by evidence, data, or explicit reasoning.
- Use concrete, specific language. Replace "significantly improved" with "improved by 23%."
- Write for the stated audience level — avoid jargon for non-technical readers, avoid over-explaining for experts.
- Present opposing viewpoints or limitations honestly, not just favorable evidence.
- Keep sections focused on one topic. Split long sections into subsections.
- Use active voice and direct statements.

## Output Format

1. **Executive Summary**: 3-5 sentences covering purpose, key findings, and primary recommendation.
2. **Background/Context**: What the reader needs to know to understand the findings.
3. **Findings**: Evidence and analysis organized by theme or question.
4. **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable next steps with rationale.
5. **Appendix** (if needed): Supporting data, methodology details, or references.
