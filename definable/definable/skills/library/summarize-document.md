## When to Use

Use this skill when summarizing documents, articles, reports, transcripts, or any long-form text. Applies to both technical and non-technical content.

## Steps

1. **Scan structure**: Identify the document type (report, article, paper, transcript) and its organizational structure (sections, headings, key divisions).
2. **Extract key points**: For each section, identify the 1-2 most important claims, findings, or arguments.
3. **Identify relationships**: Note how sections relate to each other — supporting evidence, counterarguments, cause-effect chains.
4. **Determine audience intent**: Consider why someone would read a summary (quick overview, decision-making, research).
5. **Compose summary**: Write a structured summary that preserves the document's key information in a fraction of the original length.

## Rules

- Preserve the original document's factual claims without adding interpretation unless asked.
- Use the document's own terminology and framing, not paraphrases that shift meaning.
- Include specific numbers, dates, and names when they are central to the content.
- Clearly distinguish between the document's claims and established fact.
- Scale summary length to document length: aim for 10-20% of the original length.
- Omit filler, repetition, and tangential content — focus on what would be lost if removed.

## Output Format

1. **Overview**: 1-2 sentences capturing the document's purpose and main conclusion.
2. **Key Points**: Bulleted list of the most important findings, claims, or arguments.
3. **Details**: Expanded summaries of each major section (if the document is structured).
4. **Notable Omissions**: Anything significant you chose not to include, and why.
